```

##How to use 👨‍💻

The package exports a simple function that you can pass a string of a name of more than one name in one line and it will return the name in EN

*سارة => Sarah*

##Explination 🤓

There is no role to change the Ar name to En one, so this package is me trying to find common cases to covert the names.
<br />
This package is still in early stage, so please open issues, if there is anything. Also, you may enhance it by depending on DB and make the package script for not found names.
